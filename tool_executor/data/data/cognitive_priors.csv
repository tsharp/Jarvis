Two variables may covary without a direct causal relationship.",statistical_fallacy,correlation_detected,0.95,statistics,"Don't say: 'X and Y are correlated, therefore X causes Y.'","Cognitive prior about correlation-causation distinction.

Selecting on common effect creates spurious negative correlation between its causes. Common in hospital-based studies. Never condition on colliders. Triggered with selected samples."
CP008,active,mechanism_requirement,"A plausible mechanism should connect cause to effect. Ask: How does X produce Y?",mechanistic_reasoning,causal_claim,0.93,scientific_method,"Don't say: 'X causes Y' without explaining the mechanism.","Cognitive prior requiring mechanistic explanation.

Temporal order is necessary but not sufficient.",temporal_constraint,timeline_analysis,0.88,physics,"Don't say: 'X happened before Y, so X caused Y.'","Cognitive prior about temporal precedence requirement.

Consider whether parties were blinded.",bias_reduction,subjective_outcomes,0.89,experimental_design,"Don't weight unblinded studies equally with blinded studies.","Cognitive prior about blinding importance.

Lack of specificity weakens causal inference.",causal_pattern,broad_effects,0.84,epidemiology,"Don't claim strong causation when the cause produces many unrelated effects.","Cognitive prior about specificity in causation.
