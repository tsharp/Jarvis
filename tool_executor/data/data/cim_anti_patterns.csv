AP001,Post Hoc Fallacy,"X happened before Y, therefore X caused Y.","Temporal precedence is necessary but NOT sufficient for causation. Require mechanism, rule out confounders, and consider coincidence probability.","before|after|then|followed by|preceded",critical,"Post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. Just because X happened before Y does not mean X caused Y. Temporal sequence alone is insufficient evidence for causation. Must also demonstrate mechanism and rule out confounders."
AP002,Correlation-Causation Conflation,"X and Y are correlated, so X must cause Y.","Correlation can arise from: (1) X causes Y, (2) Y causes X, (3) Common cause Z, (4) Coincidence, (5) Selection bias. Never conclude causation from correlation alone.","correlated|associated|linked|related|connection",critical,"Conflating correlation with causation. Two variables being statistically associated does not prove one causes the other. Must consider reverse causation, common causes, and spurious associations."
AP003,Ignoring Confounders,"The relationship between X and Y is direct and unconfounded.","Always ask: What third variable could cause both X and Y? List potential confounders explicitly before concluding direct causation.","direct effect|clearly causes|obviously|simple relationship",high,"Ignoring confounding variables. Failure to identify and control for confounders leads to biased causal estimates. Always enumerate potential confounders before claiming direct causation."
AP004,Collider Conditioning,"Controlling for Z (a common effect) will improve causal estimation.","NEVER condition on a collider (common effect). Conditioning on a collider creates spurious associations between its causes. Use DAG to identify colliders.","control for|adjust for|stratify by|condition on",critical,"Collider bias from conditioning on common effects. Adjusting for a collider variable opens a backdoor path and creates spurious correlation between the collider's causes. Identify colliders via DAG before adjustment."
AP005,Survivorship Bias,"The successful cases show that X leads to success.","Ask: Where are the failures? Analysis excluding failures systematically overestimates effect sizes. Require complete cohort data.","successful|winners|best performers|top|survivors",high,"Survivorship bias in causal analysis. Analyzing only surviving or successful cases ignores failed cases and inflates apparent effects. Must include complete population including failures."
AP006,Regression to Mean Confusion,"After intervention, extreme cases improved—the intervention worked.","Extreme values naturally regress toward the mean. Improvement after extreme selection may be statistical artifact, not intervention effect. Require control group.","extreme cases|worst performers|outliers improved|regression",high,"Regression to the mean misattributed as causation. Extreme values tend to be followed by less extreme values regardless of intervention. Use control groups to distinguish real effect from statistical regression."
AP007,Reverse Causation,"X causes Y (when actually Y causes X or bidirectional).","Consider: Could Y cause X instead? Could there be a feedback loop (X↔Y)? Test temporal precedence rigorously.","causes|leads to|produces|results in",high,"Reverse causation error. The assumed direction of causality may be backwards. Effect might actually cause the presumed cause, or relationship may be bidirectional. Verify temporal ordering."
AP008,Single Study Overconfidence,"This study proves X causes Y.","Single studies provide preliminary evidence only. Replication across contexts is required. Maximum confidence from single study: 0.6.","proves|demonstrates|shows definitively|establishes",high,"Overconfidence from single study evidence. One study cannot prove causation regardless of quality. Require independent replication across different populations, methods, and contexts."
AP009,Ecological Fallacy,"Group-level correlation implies individual-level causation.","Associations at group level may not hold at individual level. Cross-level inference is invalid without individual data.","countries|regions|populations|aggregate|group level",medium,"Ecological fallacy in causal inference. Correlations observed at aggregate level (e.g., countries, regions) cannot be assumed to hold for individuals within those groups."
AP010,Publication Bias Blindness,"The literature shows X causes Y (ignoring unpublished null results).","Published findings overrepresent positive results. Estimate publication bias via funnel plots. Weight evidence for likely file-drawer problem.","literature shows|studies show|research demonstrates|evidence suggests",medium,"Publication bias in evidence synthesis. Published studies overrepresent positive findings due to file-drawer effect. Negative results often unpublished. Adjust confidence for likely publication bias."
AP011,Mechanism-Free Causation,"X causes Y (without explaining how).","Causal claims require plausible mechanism. Ask: Through what process does X produce Y? Specify intermediate steps.","causes|affects|impacts|influences",medium,"Mechanism-free causal claims. Claiming causation without specifying the mechanism by which cause produces effect. Decompose into mechanistic steps and verify each."
AP012,Ignoring Effect Modification,"X causes Y uniformly across all contexts.","Effects often vary by subgroup (effect modification). Ask: For whom? Under what conditions? Heterogeneity is expected.","always|never|universally|in all cases",medium,"Ignoring effect modification and heterogeneity. Causal effects often vary across subgroups, contexts, and conditions. Uniform effects are rare. Consider interaction effects and subgroup variation."
AP013,Immortal Time Bias,"Treatment group had better outcomes (ignoring time-to-treatment).","Time periods where outcome cannot occur (e.g., pre-treatment) create spurious protective effects. Align time origins correctly.","treatment group|better outcomes|protective effect|survival advantage",high,"Immortal time bias in longitudinal studies. Time periods during which outcome cannot occur (before treatment initiation) create artificial survival advantage. Requires proper time-origin alignment."
AP014,Berkson's Paradox,"In this selected sample, X and Y are negatively correlated (so X prevents Y).","Selection on a common effect creates spurious negative correlation between causes. Hospital samples are particularly prone. Consider selection mechanism.","hospital|clinic|selected sample|referred patients",high,"Berkson's paradox from selection on common effect. In samples selected based on having a condition, causes of that condition appear spuriously negatively correlated. Common in hospital-based studies."
AP015,Simpson's Paradox Ignorance,"Overall X causes Y (but subgroups show opposite).","Aggregated trends can reverse when disaggregated. Always check subgroup consistency. Identify confounding variable driving reversal.","overall|combined|total|aggregate shows",high,"Simpson's paradox in aggregated data. Direction of association can reverse when data is disaggregated into subgroups. Must analyze at appropriate level and identify confounding structure."
AP016,Omitted Variable Bias,"The coefficient measures the true causal effect.","Regression coefficients are biased if relevant variables are omitted. Unmeasured confounders bias estimates. List omitted variables and bias direction.","coefficient|regression|model shows|beta",medium,"Omitted variable bias in regression. Excluding relevant confounders from regression biases coefficient estimates. Bias direction depends on correlations between omitted variable, exposure, and outcome."
AP017,Measurement Error Dismissal,"The measured association equals the true association.","Measurement error attenuates or inflates associations. Non-differential error biases toward null. Differential error biases unpredictably.","measured|observed|recorded|data shows",medium,"Ignoring measurement error impact. Measurement error in variables can attenuate (bias toward null) or inflate associations. Differential measurement error creates unpredictable bias."
AP018,P-Value Causation,"P < 0.05 means X causes Y.","Statistical significance indicates unlikeliness under null hypothesis, NOT causation or practical importance. Effect size and mechanism matter more.","significant|p-value|p <|statistically",medium,"Misinterpreting p-values as causal evidence. Statistical significance only indicates the data is unlikely under null hypothesis. Does not prove causation, practical significance, or effect size."
AP019,Absence-Evidence Confusion,"No evidence of effect means no effect exists.","Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Null findings may reflect low power, measurement issues, or inappropriate timing. Calculate power.","no effect|not significant|null result|failed to find",medium,"Confusing absence of evidence with evidence of absence. Null findings may result from insufficient statistical power, poor measurement, wrong timing, or true null effect. Distinguish these."
AP020,Intention-Violation Bias,"Per-protocol analysis shows true effect (ignoring dropouts).","Per-protocol analysis is biased by differential dropout. Intention-to-treat preserves randomization benefits. Report both analyses.","per-protocol|completers|adherers|those who completed",high,"Intention-to-treat violation bias. Per-protocol analysis excluding non-adherers or dropouts destroys randomization benefits and introduces selection bias. Use intention-to-treat as primary analysis."
AP021,Cherry-Picking Subgroups,"This subgroup shows effect, proving causation.","Post-hoc subgroup discoveries require replication. Multiple comparisons inflate false positives. Report all subgroups tested.","subgroup|subset|when we look at|among",medium,"Cherry-picking subgroups for desired results. Post-hoc subgroup analysis with many comparisons inflates false positive rate. Requires pre-specification or replication to validate subgroup findings."
AP022,Dose-Response Absence Dismissal,"No gradient, but X still causes Y.","Absence of dose-response weakens causal inference for monotonic relationships. Exception: threshold effects. Explain missing gradient.","same effect|no gradient|plateau|flat",low,"Dismissing absence of dose-response relationship. For most causal relationships, more exposure should produce more effect. Absence of gradient weakens causal inference unless threshold mechanism is established."
AP023,Hawthorne Effect Ignorance,"Observed behavior change proves intervention worked.","Being observed changes behavior (Hawthorne effect). Improvement may reflect observation, not intervention. Require unobserved control.","observed|monitored|watched|studied",medium,"Ignoring Hawthorne effect. Observation itself modifies behavior. Apparent intervention effects may be observation effects. Requires blinding or unobserved controls."
AP024,Recall Bias Blindness,"Retrospective reports accurately capture past exposure.","Retrospective reports are subject to recall bias. Cases may remember exposures differently than controls. Use prospective data or objective records.","recalled|remembered|reported|self-reported",medium,"Recall bias in retrospective studies. Participants with outcomes may recall exposures differently than those without. Use prospective designs or objective exposure records when possible."
AP025,Healthy User Bias,"Treatment users had better outcomes (ignoring selection).","People who engage in healthy behaviors (like taking supplements) differ systematically from non-users. Selection into treatment confounds effect.","users|takers|those who|people who chose",high,"Healthy user bias in observational studies. People who choose treatments or healthy behaviors differ systematically from non-users. Selection into treatment group confounds apparent treatment effect."
