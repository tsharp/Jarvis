PRIOR-001,Sandbox Isolation Principle,"Prevents side-channel attacks and system mutation by isolating execution state from the host OS.","Disable os, sys, and network sockets at runtime. Use strictly defined input/output channels via stdin/stdout only.","Remote Code Execution (RCE) via unsanitized import or shell escape. Host system compromise.","High security but prevents external API calls and file system persistence outside the ephemeral container.","[""isolation"", ""docker"", ""sandbox"", ""security"", ""rce""]"
PRIOR-002,Deterministic Execution,"Ensures reproducibility of results globally. Randomness without a fixed seed leads to flaky tests and undebuggable states.","Enforce fixed seeds for all PRNGs (random, numpy). Ban use of time.time() as a seed.","Non-deterministic behavior making debugging impossible. Flaky unit tests.","Reduces variability which might be desired for exploration, but essential for reliability.","[""determinism"", ""reproducibility"", ""randomness"", ""seeding""]"
PRIOR-003,No Implicit Side-Effects,"Functions must be pure where possible. Hidden side effects (network calls, file writes) break the causal chain.","Static analysis to flag IO operations outside of designated 'IO' modules. Network access disabled by default.","Unintended data leakage or corruption. brittle code that fails when environment changes.","Requires explicit dependency injection for any IO, increasing verbosity but improving testability.","[""side-effects"", ""purity"", ""functional"", ""io""]"
PRIOR-004,Input Sanitization First,"Malicious or malformed input can exploit parsing logic vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection).","Strict schema validation (Zod/Pydantic) before any processing logic. Reject unknown fields.","Injection attacks (SQL, Shell, Command). Crash due to unexpected data types.","latency overhead for validation, strict rejection of potentially valid but slightly malformed data.","[""validation"", ""sanitization"", ""input"", ""security""]"
PRIOR-005,Resource Boundedness,"Infinite loops or memory leaks can cause Denial of Service (DoS) for the agent or host system.","Hard limits on execution time (timeout) and memory usage (max_rss). Recursion depth limits.","System hang/crash due to OOM or CPU exhaustion. Cost spikes in cloud environments.","May terminate valid long-running complex calculations. Requires chunking of work.","[""performance"", ""resources"", ""dos"", ""memory"", ""time""]"
PRIOR-006,Least Privilege Access,"Agents should only have the bare minimum permissions necessary to complete the task.","Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) tokens. Filesystem read-only except for specific output directory.","Unauthorized data access or modification. Vertical privilege escalation.","Friction in development if permissions are too tight; requires granularity management.","[""security"", ""permissions"", ""rbac"", ""least-privilege""]"
PRIOR-007,Immutability by Default,"Mutable state leads to race conditions and hard-to-track state changes.","Prefer immutable data structures (tuples, frozen sets). Reassign variables rather than mutating them in place.","State corruption in concurrent execution. Heisenbugs.","Higher memory churn due to object copying, but safer logic.","[""immutability"", ""state"", ""concurrency"", ""functional""]"
PRIOR-008,Explicit Dependency Locking,"Dynamic imports or unpinned versions introduce supply chain risks and breaking changes.","All dependencies must be pinned in a lockfile (package-lock.json, poetry.lock). Ban 'import' inside functions.","Dependency confusion attacks. 'It works on my machine' syndrome. code rot.","Maintenance burden to update dependencies regularly.","[""dependencies"", ""supply-chain"", ""versioning"", ""stability""]"
PRIOR-009,Fail-Safe Defaults,"Systems should default to a safe state when they fail, rather than an open or insecure state.","Error handlers must strictly catch specific exceptions and return a secure failure object, not crash or expose stack traces.","Information disclosure via stack traces. System left in inconsistent state.","Requires thoughtful error handling logic, can hide root causes if over-generalized.","[""error-handling"", ""fail-safe"", ""security"", ""reliability""]"
PRIOR-010,Structured Observability,"Logs are data. Unstructured text logs are useless for automated debugging and monitoring.","Emit logs as JSON objects with trace IDs, levels, and structured context fields.","Inability to correlate events across services. blind spots in production.","Logs are harder to read for humans in raw format (requires distinct viewer).","[""logging"", ""observability"", ""structured-data"", ""debugging""]"
